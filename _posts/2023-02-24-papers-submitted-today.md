The first was from a massive project aimed quantifying variation in herbivory across the world! The project is called HerbVar, short for [The Herbivory Variability Network](https://herbvar.org/). It's at a high profile journal, so I won't say much more than the network surveyed 790 populations of 503 species across 200 plant families, which might add up to around 50,000 plants and 100,000 leaves sampled! Anyhow, more on that soon.

The second was addressing some editorial comments on a paper that [Allison Shaw](https://allisonkshaw.weebly.com/) and I spear-headed in the Ecological Society of America's [Bulletin](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23276096). It's a non-peer-reviewed piece summarizing the Organized Oral Session that we ran at last the 2022 annual ESA meeting on mutualism and movement! It's a good recap and we synthesize a bit on how the empirically-oriented speakers studied and presented on movement and mutualism. More on that very soon!
