I was invited by [Anita Simha](https://anitasimha.com/) and [Aubrie James](http://act.mit.edu/about/people/aubrie-james/) to speak in an Ignite Session at the annual Ecological Society of America meeting this August in Portlan, Oregon. The session title is "When the window is a mirror: how do dominant theories limit our understanding of nature?" My particular talk title is: "The need to re-source the way we think about resources in mutualism". I'm mostly excited to hear from the other speakers: I am familiar with and greatly admire so much of their work!
