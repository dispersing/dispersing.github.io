Welcome to my new website! I have been using GitHub sites & Jekyll to host my website since maybe around 2016. The most recent version of the site I forked caused some problems and my site failed to load from around September '22. After several attempts of multi-hour troubleshooting, I finally decided to abandon it and use this Jekyll theme, [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). It's super simple and I anticipate fewer problems. The tradeoff is, however, that it'll be more difficult to host all the photos I like to take. I will figure out a way of doing so while still using this simple, informative site.
